### Dependencies

- All project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Refer to the [Setting Up the Environment](#setting-up-the-environment) section for details on how to install them.

## Setting Up the Environment

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-ai-chatbot.git
cd bank-ai-chatbot
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
Ensure you have pip installed, then install the required dependencies:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
You will need to set up API keys and other configuration settings in a secrets.toml file
-Step 1: Create a ' .streamlit ' folder
-Step 2: Add the 'secrets.toml' file in the above created folder
-Step 3: Now add your COHERE_API_KEY that has been generated by you
        (To create the API key you can use the following website: https://cohere.com/)

### 4. Set Up the Virtual Environment (Optional)
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using the following commands:

``` bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Running the Application
Once the environment is set up, you can run the chatbot using Streamlit:

``` bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch the application in your browser on http://localhost:8501.

### Debugging
If you run into issues, you can check the logs or run the application in verbose mode by adding:

``` bash
streamlit run app.py --log_level=debug
```

## Using the Chatbot

Text Input: You can ask the chatbot questions about banking services, transaction details, loan agreements, etc.
Document Upload: Upload banking-related PDF documents (e.g., account statements), and the chatbot will extract relevant information.
Memory: The chatbot retains context across multiple messages during a session to improve the conversation experience.
